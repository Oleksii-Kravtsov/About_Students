My name is Rivka Bar-Chaim. I am a senior computer science major at Brooklyn College. 
Although I was born and grew up in NY, right now I am living with family in Phoenix, Arizona. The weather here is nice but I miss NY and I am excited to be bach there in the summer. 
I enjoy the excitement of programming, the problem solving and the feeling when the code finally runs properly! 
Aside from that, I like crafting, following the news, gardening, hanging out with my dog, and trying new things.
Recently I started doing woodburning and I've found it to be tons of fun. 

I am super excited about being a part of the TTP program and I can't wait to learn and for the projects I will create!
