Hi, my name is Foo wai but i mostly go by steven. My hobbies 
mostly consist of playing FPS games such as Apex. My dream is to own a
nice house on a beach front where I am just able to hang out and do nothing. 
A dream vacation for me would be visitng my home country of Malaysia and then 
going around Asia to eat all the food recommendations I have gotten but never 
able to eat. There are many other things I wish I could be able to be doing but
I am not at the level I want to be at yet.
