My name is Bohui Nong, I am born on January 6th, 2001 in China. I moved to the United States when I was little for a better education
opportunity. During my highschool career, I took an interest in computer programming and was aiming to become one myself. My hobbies 
that I enjoy during my free time are gamming, listening to music, streaming the website and walking.
