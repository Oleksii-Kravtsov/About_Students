Hey! My name is Oleksii Kravtsov, but I prefer just Alex. I like programming and I'm interested in becoming at least familiar with web development
I'm new to using git and github, but it at least able to get the simple stuff done.
I'm excited for this course as it's promising to teach me a lot of the practical things.
I really like the idea of learning more from people who already had some experience with real world programming.
Thank you for reading!
