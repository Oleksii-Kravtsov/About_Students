I am currently a Brooklyn College student, in my last year, studying computer science.
My life-long dream is to become an indie game developer and release a successful MMORPG.

My hobbies consist of: drawing, singing, piano, watching videos of K-pop group SEVENTEEN, and PC gaming.

I am passionate about environmental science, and hope to make a difference in the world against anthropogenic climate change.

The closest I have in mind for a dream vacation would be a trip to visit family in China (I have not seen them in 10 years).
However, I'm not a fan of cigarette smoke, so it wouldn't be all too fun.
Nonetheless, I'd love to reconnect with them, as well as be more attuned to my culture.
