My name is Yahia Elhag. I am a dedicated person with a family of six and a cat. I enjoy programming, often working on personal projects and experimenting on different programming languages. 
I have been successful at programming, and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. 
This flexibility will help me in TTP, where there are many different tasks and problems to approach and solve.
