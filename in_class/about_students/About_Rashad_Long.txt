My name is Rashad Long. I am born and raised in Brooklyn. I love to power lift and eat. I enjoy whiskey and cigars. I am a big movie buff and a technology junkie. I aspire to be a Cyber Security Specialist and hopefully someday run my own business. My dream vacation would be to AirBNB in a villa in Marrakesh, Morroo.
